Developed as part of the BLUE REVOLUTION project, this prototype aims to automate and speed up meiofauna extraction processes using decantation.</p> <p></p>  BLUE REVOLUTION aims to develop methods based on holographic microscopy holographic microscopy and 3D fluorescent imaging, combined with classification tools artificial intelligence, to rapidly and accurately analyze benthic biodiversity. It aims to creat accessible reference libraries and train new scientists in this field. The project contributes to th emonitoring of human impacts on marine ecosystems, particularly in the deep sea, while strengthening marine conservation efforts.  <p>To learn more about the global project, visit the Blue Revolution website.</p>"},{"location":"#what-is-meiofauna","title":"What is Meiofauna?","text":"<p>Meiofauna define a diverse assemblage of small benthic invertebrates (i.e. living in the sediment) whose size ranges from 40\u00b5m to 1mm. They are some of the most diverse group of organisms on Earth, and are ideal ecological indicators and sentinel for ecosystems health. This means that by studying them, we can deduce the state of a specific environment, and the impacts that human activity has on ecosystems.</p> <p>Yet only a small part of this diversity has been described, and knowledge of their biology and ecology is fragmentary. </p>"},{"location":"#why-the-meiomix","title":"Why the MeioMIX?","text":"<p>Studying meiofauna is a time consumming process that requires many steps such as coring sediments, sieving, extracting, fixating and identifying the animals. The goal of this prototype is to automate and speed up meiofauna extraction processes using decantation. This extraction process will be coupled with holographic and fluorescence in situ imaging to allow for rapid (e.g. 250 times faster than FlowCam) in situ recognition of individual organisms.</p> <p>The MeioMIX will make its debut on board during the EDEN scientific cruise organized by IFREMER at the end of 2024. </p>"},{"location":"page2/","title":"Set up","text":""},{"location":"page2/#technologies-used","title":"Technologies used","text":"<p>The prototype requires an Arduino Nano ESP32 with its Arduino IDE and board package, a DC motor, a peristaltic pump and 3D printed parts.
