They are some of the most diverse group of organisms on Earth, and are ideal ecological indicators and sentinel for ecosystems health. This means that by studying them, we can deduce the state of a specific environment, and the impacts that human activity has on ecosystems.</p> <p>Yet only a small part of this diversity has been described, and knowledge of their biology and ecology is fragmentary. To remedy this... blablablabla to complete.  Ok this is my final try before I give up.
